# Stage Player

Stage Player is a web-based music player application built around the Spotify Web API. It allows users to play and manage music directly from their Spotify account through an interactive interface. The app is built using  Express, Nginx, React, and Docker to provide a smooth and scalable experience.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, youâ€™ll need the following:

- A **Spotify Premium** account.
- Registered app in the **Spotify Developer Dashboard**.
- Spotify **Client ID** and **Client Secret**.
- [docker install](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).

## Technologies Used

- **Express**: Node.js framework for building API server.
- **Nginx**: Used as a reverse proxy and static file server.
- **React**: Front-end framework for building the UI.
- **Docker**: Containerization for easy deployment and scaling.

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Register the App in Spotify Developer Dashboard

1. Go to the [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/applications).
2. Create a new application.
3. Obtain the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** from the application details.
4. Set the appropriate **Redirect URIs** for OAuth. This should be good enough for now:  `http://localhost/stage_player.index.html`.


### Step 2: Clone Project

Create a `.env` file at the root of the project and fill it with the following details:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/osamsam321/StagePlayer.git
cd stage_player
cd build/docker
```
### Step 3: Setup Docker Environment Variables

Edit .env.file.sample

```bash
#GOTO ROOT FOLDER THEN RUN
cp builds/docker/.env.file.sample builds/docker/.env.file.prod
vi builds/docker/.env.file.prod
```

### Step 4: Setup React Environment Variables to modify any <domain or hosts> e.g. Set to host to localhost if desired.

Edit .env.sample

```bash
#GOTO ROOT FOLDER THEN RUN
cp stage_player_react/.env.sample stage_player_react/.env
vi builds/docker/.env
```

### Step 5: Build and Run Docker container


To add docker group: 

```bash
sudo usermod -aG docker <your_username>
```

Please run this with a user that has the docker group? Otherwise you'll need to run the below with sudo permissions.

Go into the directory below and run the shell script

```bash
cd builds/docker/
./build_run_new_docker.sh ".env.file.prod"
```
